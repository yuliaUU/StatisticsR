  - Unpaired Two Samples T-test (parametric)
  - Unpaired Two-Samples Wilcoxon Test (non-parametric)
- Comparing the means of paired samples:
  - Paired Samples T-test (parametric)
  - Paired Samples Wilcoxon Test (non-parametric)
- Comparing the means of more than two groups
  - Analysis of variance (ANOVA, parametric):
    - One-Way ANOVA Test in R
    - Two-Way ANOVA Test in R
    - MANOVA Test in R: Multivariate Analysis of Variance
