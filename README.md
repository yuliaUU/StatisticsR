**Section Summary:**

### [Normailty Test in R](https://github.com/yuliaUU/StatisticsR/blob/main/02-00-NormalityTestR.pdf)
Many of statistical tests including correlation, regression, t-test, and analysis of variance (ANOVA) assume some certain characteristics about the data. They require the data to follow a normal distribution or Gaussian distribution. These tests are called parametric tests, because their validity depends on the distribution of the data.
### [Statistical Tests and Assumptions](https://github.com/yuliaUU/StatisticsR/blob/main/03-00-StatisticalTests-andAssumptions.pdf)
Many of the statistical procedures including correlation, regression, t-test, and analysis of variance assume some certain characteristic about the data. Generally they assume that: 1) the data are normally distributed 2)and the variances of the groups to be compared are homogeneous (equal).
### [Comparing Means in R](https://github.com/yuliaUU/StatisticsR/tree/main/ComparingMeansR)
- Comparing one-sample mean to a standard known mean:
  - One-Sample T-test (parametric)
  - One-Sample Wilcoxon Test (non-parametric)
- Comparing the means of two independent groups:
  - Unpaired Two Samples T-test (parametric)
  - Unpaired Two-Samples Wilcoxon Test (non-parametric)
- Comparing the means of paired samples:
  - Paired Samples T-test (parametric)
  - Paired Samples Wilcoxon Test (non-parametric)
- Comparing the means of more than two groups
  - Analysis of variance (ANOVA, parametric):
    - One-Way ANOVA Test in R
    - Two-Way ANOVA Test in R
    - MANOVA Test in R: Multivariate Analysis of Variance
  - Kruskal-Wallis Test in R (non parametric alternative to one-way ANOVA)
